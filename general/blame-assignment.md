# Responsibility Assignment

A question that is often raised among Sysadmins is who is responsible for various tasks/components of the Lab.  And the answer is not often simple.

Although all Sysadmins are ultimately responsible for the effective functioning of the Lab,  various people have more domain expertise than others.  In almost all cases, there is a designated lead for a functional area who is responsible for that functional area along with other that work within that area.

The lead is responsible for determining who should be within the functional area and the delegation of responsibilities for that area.  The lead should be the main contact person for concerns about that specific area.
