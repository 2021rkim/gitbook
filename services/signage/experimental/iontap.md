# IonTap

**IonTap** is an experimental project to allow users to signup for 8th period on Signage displays.  The project is led by Keegan Lanzillotta.  Code for the prototype TapIn can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/keegan/TapIn).  The project would rely on issued NFC cards as identifications and touch Signage displays as kiosks.
