# Maintainer Workflow

Maintainers of the Ion repository are responsible for the effective functioning of Ion.  Generally, the Ion maintainers are the Ion leads for the years plus other senior Ion developers.  

## Responsibilities

Ion maintainers need to ensure that the code base remains good quality and ensures that nothing will break.

Maintainers have the following responsibilities:

* Triaging issues \(labeling, closing issues as appropriate\)
* Reviewing pull requests
* Maintaining our CI pipeline \(run via Travis\)
* Ensuring the CI pipeline does not fail 
* Ensuring the code's compliance with the Ion Style Guide
* Protecting Ion from security threats
* Redacting private information from the Git repository
* Determining the best course of action to take \(being the final arbiters of decisions affecting Ion\)

## Issues

We have a system of labeling issues that are opened in the Ion repository.  Examples of labels that we have include:

* Browser compat
* Bug
* Cache
* Client-side
* Docs
* Enhancement
* Feature
* Feedback
* Help Wanted
* Invalid
* Question
* Server-side
* Vagrant
* Upstream
* Wontfix

Issues out of the repository's scope should be closed.  Duplicates of other issues should also be closed.  Maintainers should however be respectful of people who open issues.

## Pull Requests

Determining what code should be included in the Ion repository is a decision that lies ultimately with the Ion Lead.  Together with the Lead Sysadmins and the Faculty Sponsor, they serve as the FINAL decision makers on whether to include or remove from Ion.

Pull requests should be reviewed fairly regularly so that contributors can respond to the feedback that is given by the reviewers.  The process for determining who should authorize/approve merges into the `dev` and `master` branches is to be determined each year by the Ion Lead.
