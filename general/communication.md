# Communication

## Overview

Communication is important to the effective functioning of the Lab.  We use Slack as our primary form of communication within the Student Systems Administrator program.  Communication through e-mail is used to communicate with various stakeholders in the TJ community.  IRC is used as a fallback form of communication in the event Slack is down.

## Slack

Slack \([https://slack.com](https://slack.com)\) is a proprietary set of tools for team collaboration.  It offers various integration with different services.  We have a workspace at [https://tjcsl.slack.com](https://tjcsl.slack.com).
