# TJHSST Account Guide

There are three different accounts that each TJHSST student has:

* FCPS domain
* LOCAL domain
* CSL domain

## FCPS Domain

The FCPS domain is controlled by the FCPS IT department.  Students use the FCPS domain to access:

* Blackboard
* SIS StudentVue
* FCPS Google Apps for Education
* FCPS computers \(those running Windows 10\)

Password resets on the FCPS domain are handled on the first day of school in homeroom \(on a teacher laptop\).  Questions should be directed to [techteam@tjhsst.edu](mailto:techteam@tjhsst.edu)
