# PR Workflow

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of Git is a good to have for Ion development since we store code in Git and use GitHub 

## Branching

Work for production is stored in the `master` branch in the [Ion repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tjcsl/ion).  The `dev` branch stores information for Ion developers to test code for production. 

Non-Ion maintainers should develop on their own forks of the main GitHub repository.  You can read about it [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

## Preparation

When you think your code is ready to reviewed, it is important to ensure your changes comply with the Ion code guidelines.  Here are some general guidelines

* First, you should review your code for compliance with the [Ion Style Guide](style-guide.md).  
* Second, you should make sure that only changes you wanted to make exist in your branch.
* Third, you should run the Ion test suite.
