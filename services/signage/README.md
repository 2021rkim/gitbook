# Signage

**Signage** refers to the set of eleven electronic displays located all over the school. A "Signage" refers to a display that displays useful information maintained by the CSL across the school.

Currently, each Signage display shows the:

* Schedule
* Map of school
* Announcements
* Bus map

The Signage displays also can show special event information.

The core of Signage runs on Intel Compute Sticks \([official website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/compute-stick.html)\).
