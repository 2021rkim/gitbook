# Printing

Printing is a production service offered by the Computer Systems Lab.  We provide the means for students to print from Ion and the CSL workstations.

## Printers
We currently have one functioning printer:
* printer202 (in Room 202)
  * This is a HP LaserJet P3015

We currently have two non-functioning printers:
* printer200
* printer200c

## Ion Printing

There is a web interface to provide printing services on Ion at [https://ion.tjhsst.edu/printing](https://ion.tjhsst.edu/printing).  Ion uses the CUPS server at `cups2.csl.tjhsst.edu` to manage jobs. Relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/tjcsl/ion/tree/master/intranet/apps/printing).

# Workstation Printing

Each workstations uses the CUPS server at `cups2.csl.tjhsst.edu` to manage jobs and send them to the printers.
