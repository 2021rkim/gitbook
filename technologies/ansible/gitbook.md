# GitBook

GitBook is the documentation platform used by the Computer Systems Lab.  It is the central hub of knowledge.

## History

The CSL's GitBook came into existence after frustration with inadequate documentation on Livedoc.  Initially began by Theo Ouzhinski in late August of 2018, GitBook now serves as the CSL's official documentation source.
