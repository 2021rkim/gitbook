# HPC Cluster

The **HPC Cluster** is the CSL's main **H**igh **P**erformance **C**omputing Cluster.

**It should only be accessed through** [Slurm](../../services/cluster/slurm.md)! See the page on [Cluster](../../services/cluster/) for more details.

## Technical Specifications

| **Specification** | Description |

## Trivia

Each of the nodes in the HPC cluster is named after a [robot from Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Futurama_characters), making them hard to remember \(although not nearly as hard as the [Borg Cluster](../borg-cluster.md)!\).
