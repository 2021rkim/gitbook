# Database

Ion is backed by a PostgreSQL database that stores all valuable information and data.  It is also the most important piece of data within Ion.

We use Django to handle interactions with the database.  Configurations for the database are in the Ion [settings](https://github.com/tjcsl/ion/blob/master/intranet/settings/__init__.py).
