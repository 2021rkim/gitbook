# Ceph

## Introduction
The computer systems lab uses [Ceph](https://ceph.com) as its main storage infrastructure.  We chose to use Ceph because of its scalability, redundancy, and reliability.  

## Servers
Currently, we have 3 OSD servers and 1 monitor/manager server in the Ceph cluster.  Each OSD server ([karel](https://tjcsl.gitbook.io/project/machines/ceph/karel), [wumpus](https://tjcsl.gitbook.io/project/machines/ceph/wumpus), and [stobar](https://tjcsl.gitbook.io/project/machines/ceph/stobar) ) has 12*4TB HDD and 2*400GB SSDs.
