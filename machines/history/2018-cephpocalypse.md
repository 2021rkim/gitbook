# 2018 Cephpocalypse

The **Cephpocalypse** (hah, I've officially named it now, no one can stop me~) was an event occurring in the fall of the 2018-2019 school year, when the Ceph servers, then our main point of failure, went completely offline. This incident demonstrated the capability of the Sysadmin team and prompted us to start thinking about ways to remove that one point of failure (say, through a backup system).

The purpose of this document is to record our mistakes and remedial actions so that future generations may learn from them
