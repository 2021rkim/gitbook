# GitBook

GitBook is the documentation platform used by the Computer Systems Lab.  It is the central hub of knowledge.  It is hosted on [gitbook.com](https://gitbook.com), a proprietary platform.

## History

The CSL's GitBook came into existence after frustration with inadequate documentation on Livedoc.  Initially began by Theo Ouzhinski in late August of 2018, GitBook now serves as the CSL's official documentation source.  

### Livedoc

Livedoc is a self-hosted MediaWiki installation hosted on Director at [livedoc.tjhsst.edu](https://livedoc.tjhsst.edu).  It was originally set up on November 2, 2005 by Dan Tran.  It is currently not being updated.  

### The Book

**The Syslab Book** was a documentation project numerous years in the works, with contributions from Andy Barros, Matthew Colyer, Andrew Deason, Susan Ditmore, Jeffrey Grafton, John Livingston, Ilia Mirkin, Kyle Moffett, and Dan Tran. Prior to Livedoc, this was essentially the only documentation on the SysLab.

#### Format

The Book used DocBook format for all of its pages \(which is SGML, but mostly looks like XML\). It was thought by some to be a rather cumbersome format to update and use in general, which is one of the reasons Livedoc exists.

## Structure

GitBook, the website, allows the creation of a GitBook account via e-mail, GItHub, or Google.  Every account can be a member of a different organizations which in turn have their own workspaces.  Workspaces can be either publicly available or restricted.

The TJCSL organization contains the TJ CSL workspace which contains all of our public documentation for SysAdmins.

The official GitBook documentation can be found [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/).

## Access Control

The Lead SysAdmins, Faculty Sponsor, and Documentaiton Lead should be owners/admins of the TJCSL organization.  Other SysAdmins should have write access to the documentation.  The expectation is that you do not violate the trust that is given to you.

## Editing

Editing for GitBook can be done via a git repo or the visual editor.
