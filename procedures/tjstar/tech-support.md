# Tech Support

### Planning and Organization

Mr. Resquin was the contact for tech team. Sysadmins who are interested in doing tech team should report their availability to whoever is running signups. They should be placed in the Tech Team constraints sheet.

### Setup the Day Before

Depending on how the logistics work out, it might be a good idea to start this during the school day the day before, so that staff is on hand if you run into networking difficulties or, more importantly, **locked doors** \(like in 2018\).

Setup involves hooking up laptops in the keynote streaming rooms. Again, these rooms may be locked, so it's probably a good idea to have a faculty or staff member with you during setup.
