# Grafana

**Grafana** \([https://grafana.com/](https://grafana.com/)\) is an open-source platform for analytics and monitoring.   Using multiple dats sources \(like Prometheus\), Grafana allows us to visualize metrics.  Their official repository is located [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) although we download our Grafana from the Ubuntu APT repositories.

Our CSL Grafana is located at [https://grafana.tjhsst.edu/](https://grafana.tjhsst.edu/) \(only on the CSL network\).  

## Installation

It is as simple as a

```bash
apt update && apt install grafana
```
