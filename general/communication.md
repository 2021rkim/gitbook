# Communication

## Overview

Communication is important to the effective functioning of the Lab.  We use Slack as our primary form of communication within the Student Systems Administrator program.  Communication through e-mail is used to communicate with various stakeholders in the TJ community.  IRC is used as a fallback form of communication in the event Slack is down.

## Slack

Slack \([https://slack.com](https://slack.com)\) is a proprietary set of tools for team collaboration.  It offers various integration with different services.  We have a workspace at [https://tjcsl.slack.com](https://tjcsl.slack.com).

### Channels

Conversations in Slack are organized into public and private channels.  You can join a public channel by clicking on the`+` icon.  Private \(invite-only\) channels require an invite from someone within the channel.  Use invite-only channels for sensitive or non-public discussions.

Some channels include:

* \#general: For general discussions
* \#random: For random discussions
* \#ion: For discussion of Ion
* \#director: For discussion of Director
* and other channels

### Applications

Workspace members can add applications to the channels to improve the SysAdmin's workflow.  Some examples of integrated applications include:

* Sentry: Notifies Sysadmins of errors/events on web applications

{% page-ref page="../technologies/monitoring/sentry.md" %}

* Uptime Robot: Notifies SysAdmins of downtime on critical public-facing CSL-maintained webpages

{% page-ref page="../technologies/monitoring/uptime-robot.md" %}

* Asana: Keeps track of tasks assigned to SysAdmins

{% page-ref page="../technologies/ansible/asana.md" %}

### Best Practices

* Keep conversations in relevant channels.
  * Don't talk about account recovery in the Signage channel, etc.
* Don't spam.
  * Don't make people annoyed with notifications from a channel to the point where they mute the channel
* Use proper ettiquete and be respectful.
  * There is no need to be disrespectful in the Slack channels.
* Keep private conversations in DM
  * Don't pollute channels with unnecessary messages

### Roles

Workspace owners have full administrative access to the workspace.  The owners can remove members and change workspace settings.  The lead SysAdmin\(s\) and Faculty Sponsor should be owners and should designate other owners they find necessary.

Workspace members can join, write, and read in public channels..  They can also join, write, and read in invite-only channels.  They can also create new public or invite-only channels.

The workspace membership should be restricted to people with an `@tjhsst.edu` e-mail.
