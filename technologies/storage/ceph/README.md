# Ceph

## Introduction

The computer systems lab uses [Ceph](https://ceph.com) as its main storage infrastructure. We chose to use Ceph because of its scalability, redundancy, and reliability.

## Servers

Currently, we have 3 OSD servers and 1 monitor/manager server in the Ceph cluster. Each OSD server \([karel](../../../machines/ceph/karel.md), [wumpus](../../../machines/ceph/wumpus.md), and [stobar](../../../machines/ceph/stobar.md) \) has 12×4TB HDD and 2×400GB SSDs.
