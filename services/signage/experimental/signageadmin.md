# SignageAdmin

**SignageAdmin** is an experimental project to administer the Signage displays.  It would use localized `mousescript` installations to detect tampering of the Signage displays. It would also provide a web interface to administer the Signage displays.  The project is led by John Beutner and Theo Ouzhinski.  The code can be found in the [signage3 namespace on GitLab](https://gitlab.tjhsst.edu/signage3).  Further information can be found there.
